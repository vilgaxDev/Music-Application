# Content creation & management

Muzzie supports multiple content types:

<ul-comp :items="[
'Songs ( simple audio files or youtube videos )',
'Albums',
'Podcasts',
'Playlists'
]
" />


## Who can create content on Muzzie

3 users can create and publish content on Muzzie by default. However, you can decide and restrict what everyone can do and upload by adjusting their permissions. To do that all you have to do is to go to your admin dashboard then go to Roles. There you can see all the permissions that every user has and edit them. 

The content creators are :

### Users
 users can upload songs only. An uploaded song by a user is by default private, but they can change its privacy to public and everyone can see it. Meantime you can control that by removing this permission from the users.

<strong>1.</strong> Go to the admin dashboard

<strong>2.</strong> Go to Roles

<strong>3.</strong> Remove the permission "edit own songs privacy" from the user section

<strong>4.</strong> Save changes at the top right


<strong>NB:</strong> this operation removes the permission from <strong>upcoming users only</strong>. To edit permissions for individual users that have been already created, go to "Users" on your admin dashboard, then click the <strong>edit</strong> icon button to manage the permissions.

### Artists

An artist can be either created directly by an admin or requested from a user. Every user has by default the right to request an artist account. 

See [How to request an artist account](/guide/content-creation-and-management/how-to-request-artist-account.md)


Artists can have their accounts where they can upload songs, albums, and podcasts. Like users, admins can restrict what an artist should be uploading with the following steps: 

<strong>1.</strong> Go to the admin dashboard

<strong>2.</strong> Go to Roles

<strong>3.</strong> Click on the edit icon/button of the artist's section

<strong>4.</strong> Select what permissions an artist should have then click "Confirm"

<strong>CED</strong> is an abbreviation of CREATE, EDIT, and DELETE

<strong>5.</strong> Save changes at the top right


### Admins

Admins can create all types of content, but you can also adjust everyone's permissions and what they can upload (just like we did with artists).

### Important notes

<strong>1.</strong> Artists don't have the right to manage pages and their content, which means that their content will only appear in non-custom sections ( ex: most played songs) unless you added it in custom ones. So currently admins are the only ones who can promote the artist's content.

<strong>2.</strong> Charts is a pre-created page where all non-custom sections exist( The "Charts" page can be found on browse > charts ).
