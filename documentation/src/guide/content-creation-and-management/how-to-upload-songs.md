### Important notes

<strong>1.</strong> You can upload multiple songs at the same time.

<strong>2.</strong> Admins have an extra option "Attach an existing artist". This option allows attaching a song to an artist account that has been already created on Muzzie. This helps to link both sides to each either, so you can go directly to the artist profile from a song and vice versa.
