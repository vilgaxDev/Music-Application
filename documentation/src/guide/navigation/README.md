# Navigation & Navigation items

We offer a great navigation customization tool. It helps you customize completely the links on the navigation bar. You can create, edit, delete, or hide these navigation items, not only that but you can also customize their icons and text.

This is the navigation settings windows. You can find it by going to your admin dashboard > "Appearance" > "Navigation".

Navigation item is characterized by:

<strong>1.</strong> Name: to identify the item.

<strong>2.</strong> Icon: This is the icon showing on the item. The icons that we use are from the [materialsdesigicons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) library. To choose an icon you need only its name. All you have to do is to go to their website and you will get an input field where you can search for the icon that you want. Grab the icon name and add it to your navigation item ( ex: the name of our pre-created item "Upload" icon is "cloud-upload" )

<strong>3.</strong> Navigates to: this is field specifies whether the selected item should navigate to a:

<strong>a.</strong> Custom link: Could be an internal or external link (ex: google.com)

<strong>b.</strong> Custom page: One of the pages that you already created ( See: [How to create a custom page](/guide/pages-and-sections/how-to-create-custom-page.md))

if you select "Custom page", a new field is going to appear, in which you can select one of the pages that already exist.


## Important notes

You can hide a navigation item. This helps you to arrange the items the way you want and avoid deleting items that you might need.

You can also reset the default items by clicking the button "Reset".
